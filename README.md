This project analyzes global unemployment trends from 1991 to 2022, aiming to uncover insights regarding the factors influencing unemployment rates and the impact of significant economic crises.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

- To examine unemployment trends over three decades.
- To analyze demographic insights and regional differences.
- To assess the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates.

The dataset includes unemployment rates for various countries, covering the years 1991 to 2022. Key attributes include:

- **Country:** Name of the country.
- **Year:** Year of the recorded unemployment rate.
- **Unemployment Rate:** Percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Checked for missing values and ensured data types were correct.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for unemployment rates.
3. **Trend Analysis:** Analyzed changes over time and visualized them with line graphs.
4. **Demographic Insights:** Compared unemployment rates across different demographics and regions.
5. **Crisis Analysis:** Focused on trends during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. **Average Global Unemployment Rate (2021):** Calculated the mean unemployment rate for all countries in 2021.
2. **Highest Unemployment Rate (2021):** Identified the country with the highest unemployment rate in 2021.
3. **Global Unemployment Rate Change (1991-2021):** Analyzed the mean for each year and plotted a line graph.
4. **Most Improved Country (2011-2021):** Compared unemployment rates between 2011 and 2021 to find the country with the most improvement.
5. **Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis:** Analyzed trends from 2008 to 2010.
6. **COVID-19 Impact:** Compared unemployment rates of 2019, 2020, and 2021.

8. **Anomalies in the Dataset:** Identified unusual spikes or drops and researched historical events.
9. **Most Stable Employment Market:** Grouped countries by region and calculated the standard deviation of unemployment rates.
10. **2021 Histogram:** Created a histogram of unemployment rates for 2021.

## Visualizations

- Line graphs showing trends in unemployment rates from 1991 to 2021.
- Bar charts comparing unemployment rates across different demographics.
- A histogram illustrating the distribution of unemployment rates for 2021.

## Recommendations

- Implement targeted training programs to equip job seekers with necessary skills.
